# HDL-Lab4-ParkingMeter
The objective in this lab is to design (code, simulate and implement) a parking meter much like the ones around Austin. It should be able to simulate coins being added and show the appropriate time remaining. Also, it should flash slowly when less than 200 seconds are remaining and flash quickly when time has expired.
